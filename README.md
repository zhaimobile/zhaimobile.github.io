OneDrive Explorer web app

This sample illustrates the basic concepts for interacting with the OneDrive API to create a file explorer web app.

Included in this project:

* OneDriveExplorer (index.html) - A sample web app to view the contents of the signed in user's OneDrive and show the JSON structures returned by the API.
* ODAuth (odauth.js) - A simple js library for handling the OAuth2 implicit grant flow for OneDrive. Used by the OneDriveExplorer web app.
